##ystems Analysis and Development

I'm a student at FIAP, currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. I am seeking to grow professionally in my areas of interest, which include Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence (A.I), and Front-end development.
With this profile, my goal is not only to share my projects but also to document my progress and apply continuous improvement throughout my journey.
